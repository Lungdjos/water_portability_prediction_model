The first training of the model with 15% testing data set produced the following results:
ph                 491
Hardness             0
Solids               0
Chloramines          0
Sulfate            781
Conductivity         0
Organic_carbon       0
Trihalomethanes    162
Turbidity            0
dtype: int64
Training Accuracy: 1.0
Testing Accuracy: 0.6829268292682927
After training and obtaining the results above, the model will be optimized to have the best accuracy.
